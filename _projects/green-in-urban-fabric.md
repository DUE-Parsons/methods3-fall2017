Trees are vital to the urban form of cities and function as living building materials that frame space and humanize the urban environment. Trees are inseparable from the urban structure â€“ trees are the only design element that can link an entire city together. However, many urban designs, codes, and public works standards show that little is known about the basic needs of trees and the principles of tree planting. In most cases, trees are viewed as visual support roles along sidewalks or in public space. 

My research object is street trees in New York City, and try to provide a set of tools that can be used to develop cost effective designs that create beautiful urban places. From street tree density in 2015, it can be seen that some areas need to be covered more green.

According to planting process in NYC Parks website, I do the survey about dead trees and damaged trees from 311 data and stump removal conditions in order to map requested planting location.

Then I get the data about those upcoming planting location by NYC Parks, and their progress status.

Considering the urban environment, I make these locations attached to zoning plan. The purpose of it is to understand the function of new trees.

My next step is to focus on tree species selection method viewing from urban natural environment factors, like climates, air quality and soil condition. And I will make comparison about these each factor in five boroughs. The most important research I will do is to attach population density to tree condition in that area, which can show the favorite tree planting design among urban population.
